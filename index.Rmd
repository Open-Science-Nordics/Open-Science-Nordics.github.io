On the 23rd of January 2017 a symposium about Open Source systems^[see [Open Source Systems in the Public Sector](http://www.nrm.se/english/researchandcollections/symposiumopensourcesystems.os2017.html) announcement] in the public sector was held in Stockholm at the Swedish Museum of Natural History.

On the 24th - 25th of January 2017 a two-day workshop^[see the "[ROpenSci for all](http://www.nrm.se/english/researchandcollections/symposiumopensourcesystems.os2017.html)" announcement] was arranged on the topic of using reproducible open research workflows with R for biodiversity analysis.

```

`r newthought('The symposium ')` was given during one day and materials covered included serveral talks about using open source systems in the public sector.

More details about the full programme can be found in the program announcement.^[[Symposium Programme](http://www.nrm.se/english/researchandcollections/symposiumopensourcesystems/program.9003769.html)] Links to presentations will be added below as presenters make their materials available ...
